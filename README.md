## Code Requirements
You can install Anaconda for python, which solves all the problems.You can use Spyder , as it has best integrated developing environment and is easy to use.You can also install Pycharm for running this code.

## Description
This is a ML model to classify whether a cell is infected with  Parkinsons Diseasen or it is2 healthy.This model is made with  KNN, Naive Bayes, SVM and Random Forest Classifier.The best results I got with KNN and Random Forest Classifier. The f1_score and accuracy_score for both came the same.The f1_score is 0.965  with an accuracy of 94.87%.You can find the number of incorrect predictions through confusion matrix, for which I got 2 incorrect predictions through both KNN and Random Forest Classifier model.

After completion of the Machine Learning project, the ML model need to deploy in an application. To deploy, the ML model need to save it first. To save the Machine Learning project we can use the pickle or joblib package.Here I have used pickle package of python to load and save the model.The pickle or joblib package saves the model to that address, later on to deploy the model we can simply load the model through the pickle file that I have included here or you can make by running the code.
